                Hello! I'm Adam Barnard, a 22-year-old aspiring programmer living in Calais, Maine. I graduated from Washington County Community College with an Associate's 
                degree in Business Management and a certificate in Entrepreneurship. My journey into the world of programming started with a passion for technology 
                and problem-solving. I'm currently honing my skills to become proficient in programming languages and software development. In addition to my academic achievements, 
                I hold a Red Cross CPR First Aid certification and am qualified to teach others CPR techniques. My diverse work experience includes roles as a clerk at a 
                movie theater, a lifeguard at a local pool, and an Educational Technician at an elementary school. I also gained valuable insights during my internship at the 
                Calais Water Department, where I learned about utility management and community service. Currently, I am gaining hands-on experience at Calais Computer Plus, 
                where I continue to expand my knowledge of computer systems and technology. Outside of work and study, I enjoy exploring new programming projects, staying active 
                in my community, and finding innovative solutions to everyday challenges. Feel free to connect with me to discuss programming, technology, or any exciting 
                opportunities!
            </p>
